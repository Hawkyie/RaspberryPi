# Challenge 4. Raspberry Pi – Detect and Alarm

## Outline

The base’s protection sensors have stopped working,
specifically the MAC address detector. You need to design and build a replacement
system. 

## User Requirements

  - Must monitor Wi-Fi access points and MAC addresses. Make sure your system
  saves this data in an appropriate format for analysis.
  - Must alert if known bad MAC addresses or SSIDs are detected
  - Should take a photograph when the bad MAC address / SSID is detected
  - Should provide a GUI or way to search the MAC addresses and WiFi access
  points that have been detected.
  - Could provide a distance and direction estimate to the MAC address / SSIDs
  detected.
